Currently, multiple repository functions are just delegating to services and not doing much more logic.

From service to repository we should ideally have:
1.Data is adapted between domain models and raw service results.
2.Business logic like caching, token refresh, validation, error handling, or transformations is applied.
3.Multiple data sources (e.g., network + local DB) are combined.

This is already true in some code such as EventRepositoryImpl.createEvent which uses AuthService to
first retrieve an authentication token before proceeding with calling EventService
