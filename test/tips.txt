Test description tips: Given, When, Then style
Test structure tips: line separated logical groupings of statements that Arrange, Act, Assert
Use setUp/setUpAll/tearDown/tearDownAll where it makes sense to avoid code duplication
Use groups{} for hierarchy and efficiency, but be careful of tess depending on each other
use async await where necessary
Test should not depend on external factors (Use mockito to mock for example http requests when testing repositories)
Do not use the await keyword when expecting the function to throw an exception
